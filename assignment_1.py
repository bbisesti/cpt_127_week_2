Welcome to week 2!

In order for this assignment to work you will need to install two libraries:

- python-dotenv
- sql alchemy

You can install these by opening a terminal on your Linux VM and running:

sudo apt-get install python3-dotenv

sudo apt-get install python3-sqlalchemy

You will be prompted to install both (please enter 'Y') when prompted.  

Once those have been installed and you have created/filled-out your .env file then this program should run!

Please make sure it runs successfully before moving on to assignment_2.py!
