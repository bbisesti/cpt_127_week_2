# Weekly Assignment Instructions


### Overview
This assignment will provide an introduction to Python functions!

### Learning Outcomes
By the end of this assignment, you should be able to read code with functions and determine the order that functions are called, as well as which functions are performing what programming logic, what their parameters are, how to create/use your own custom functions!

Functions are a VERY useful programming construct which allows you to write code which can be called many times!  This is useful in that you can perform the same sequence of programming logic repeatedly without needing to write the code repeatedlyl.  In fact - if you find yourself writing the same code repeatedly you are probably in need of a function!  

Further, you can write functions which include "parameters", which are variables that you can pass to them!  You may recognize these from code you saw in week 1!  I had created a couple of functions which were used to display user input out to the screen in a consistent format.  This week you will be the one creating and using functions!

### Instructions
1. **Review the following materials**:

   - [W3Schools Python Functions](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp)
        Please read this introduction regarding Python functions!

   ### Reference

   The following are libraries you will need to install to make the programs we will be running this week work!  Don't worry if you don't follow what they are doing (yet!) you will just need them for the assignments to run.  These are reference materials if you'd like to read more about them!

   - [Python DotEnv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
        
        You will need to install this library to load environment variables for this program to work!  Environment variables are VERY useful for migrating your programs/scripts from computer to computer without needing to search for configuration changes! 

   - [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

        This library is useful for connecting to a variety of Structured Query Language (SQL) databases! Though you will not be required to write SQL in this class, these "relational" databases as they are known are very useful for storing a myriad of data in an efficently organized and easily queried way!  In fact you have already been interacting with a PostgreSQL database through the Discord server! 


3. **Complete the following tasks**:
   - assignment_1.py:
     
       This assignment will provide an overview of functions as well as introduce you to the concept of installing libraries!
       
   - assignment_2.py:
     
       This assignment will continue to help build up your ability to review and fix other people's code!  Please make sure you fill out the .env file (I will post .env file variables on your class Discords) 
       and fix the code errors.  Once the code has been fixed the program should run and you will see a success message!
   - assignment_3.py:
     
       Here be some practice with functions!  Please complete the functions as assigned in this file!
   
4. **Please commit your code to a public GitHub repository**
    - Once you have completed all three tasks in your code please commit your updated python code to a public repository in GitHub!
    - Once you have a public repository link submit that link to the week one assignment in Brightspace!
